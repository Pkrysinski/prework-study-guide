# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The reason for this study guide is to both provide a content repository for notes we take along the way of the Bootcamp, as well as practice and demonstrate our skills we've learned along the way.  I've been motivated for success on this Bootcamp out of my own sheer will to learn web development and further my career as a programmer.  Creating this study guide has helped me learn the fundamentals of web development that will serve as useful building blocks for projects moving forward.
